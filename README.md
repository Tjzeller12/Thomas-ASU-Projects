# Thomas-ASU-Projects
This contains four projects that I created with a team of four other students at Arizona State University in CSE 205 Object Oriented Programing. 
This code demonstrates my knowledge of basic Data Structures and  Algorithms. I am looking forward to my jorney in Software Engneering!
